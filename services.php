            <h2>parents and carers</h2>
            <p>
                At Broad Horizons we pride ourselves on working in partnership with parents and carers. We understand that the decision to enter into therapy is not always easy and that the journey itself can be rocky. It is for this reason that we provide a highly supportive role with parents and carers of children and young people who are on their therapy journey with us. We are acutely aware that the journey to healing and recovery takes more than 50 minutes a week in a therapy room and therefore we are wholly inclusive of parents and carers in the entire process. 6 weekly reviews with parents and carers and other professionals involved with your child are standard practice as is attendance at other mutli-agency professional meetings as required. Broad Horizons can also offer Therapeutic parenting sessions to support your understanding of the needs of your child from a therapeutic perspective and also provides the opportunity for you to have some time to share worries and concerns that often go hand in hand with parenting a child that requires professional support of any kind.

            <h2>supervision</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Clinical</b> supervision if offered for psychotherapists, counsellors and play therapists. This is an opportunity to explore, either in groups or individually, the efficacy of your practice as a therapist and the impact of the therapeutic relationship on yourself as a practitioner.<br><b>Wellbeing</b> Supervision and Case Supervision are also offered to practitioners such as pastoral support education staff, teachers and teaching assistants, social workers, health care professionals and other professionals that work with children young people or families. The supervision is a space to explore issues relating to the individual you support in order to achieve best outcomes for children and families, as well as the impact on yourself as a practioner. Both will often overlap, however at Broad Horizons we will tailor the focus of the supervision to your needs.
