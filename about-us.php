We are privileged at Broad Horizons to have a large number of experienced and highly qualified therapists enabling us to tailor made packages of support that meet the individuals need.<br>We pride ourselves on adopting a holistic family approach to our work with children and young people and are inclusive of multi-agency working and being proactive as part of the team around the child and family to provide the best possible outcomes for children, young people and families.

            I first founded Broad Horizon in 2001, at the time as an individual practitioner. I am passionate about ensuring we move away from viewing children, young people or adults needing therapy as dysfunctional. At Broad Horizons we value individual’s strength and creativity when met with challenge, trauma or adversity. My motivation in creating a diverse therapeutic service was to ensure that children and families are not expected to fit into whatever services are available, but ensure that services including therapy, parent support, training etcetera are tailored to the individual child and family’s needs.
